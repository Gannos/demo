* Description
A simple example of modern, fullstack web development.

You'll find:
- docker-compose deployment
- a python backend (FastAPI -- HTTP and WebSockets; TortoiseORM)
- a SvelteKit frontend with SSR, form validation, and type safety; UI with
  Skeleton + TailwindCSS for theming.
- an nginx reverse proxy to handle secure communication
- postgres db

* Wanna run it?
Technically: ~cd <path-to-local-repo> && make build~

This is still in the works; be advised. You may have to rebuild or adjust
configs.
